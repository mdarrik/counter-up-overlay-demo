# Count-Up Overlay Demo

This is a demo overlay, which counts up to a specified number in a specified amount of time. 

## To Use

Edit the `durationInMilliseconds` to be the number of milliseconds you want the count to last for. 

Edit the `countTotal` to be the number you want the count to end at. 

When ready to start the count. Run `yarn start` and open http://localhost:1234. The countdown will start immediately. 

If you need the counter on a different port. run `yarn start -p <new port number>`
