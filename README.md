Made for Guthron. 

## To Use

1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies. 

2. Edit the `durationInMilliseconds` to be the number of milliseconds you want the count to last for. 

3. Edit the `countTotal` to be the number you want the count to end at. 

4. When ready to start the count. Run `yarn start` and open http://localhost:1234. The countdown will start immediately.
